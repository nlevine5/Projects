# Projects
A Repository Created to Display Projects I Have Completed:

When I first arrived at Binghamton University, I was undecided regarding what I wanted to study, nonetheless what I wanted to do after college. Throughout my time there, I have grown a passion for my major, financial economics, along with a deep interest in my minor, data studies, which I have expressed through Python coding projects and Tableau visualizations! I hope to continue these areas of interest in a Summer 2024 internship in related fields such as data analysis, consulting, financial planning, and more!
